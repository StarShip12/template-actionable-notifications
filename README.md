When a helpdesk ticket is created in a 3rd party system, send an actionable notification in Slack that allows the user to claim the ticket or apply a label.

## Setup

#### Create a Slack app

1. Create an app at api.slack.com/apps
1. Activate Incoming Webhooks from the Features > **Incoming Webhooks** then click 'Add New Webhook to Workspace', install the app and select a channel
1. Navigate to the **OAuth & Permissions** page and add the following scopes:
  * **Bot scopes**
    * `incoming-webhook` (This should be pre-selected)
    * `chat:write` (to send messages)
  * **User scope** 
    * `users:read` (to read users info)
  

#### Run the app

Clone this repo to run locally or 

[![Remix on Glitch](https://cdn.glitch.com/2703baf2-b643-4da7-ab91-7ee2a2d00b5b%2Fremix-button.svg)](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/remix/slack-actionable-notification-blueprint)

1. Get the code
    * Either clone this repo and run `npm install`
    * Or visit https://glitch.com/edit/#!/remix/slack-actionable-notification-blueprint
1. Set the following environment variables to `.env` (see `.env.sample`):
    * `SLACK_TOKEN`: Your app's `xoxp-` token (available on the **OAuth & Permissions**)
    * `SLACK_WEBHOOK`: The webhook URL that you copied off the **Incoming Webhook**
    * `SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET`: Your app's Signing secret (available on the **Basic Information**)
1. If you're running the app locally:
    1. Start the app (`npm start`)
    1. In another window, start ngrok on the same port as your webserver (`ngrok http $PORT`)

#### Enable Interactive Components
1. Go back to the app settings and click on Interactive Components.
1. Set the Request URL to your ngrok URL (or Glitch URL) + `/interactive-message` (such as `https://my-project.glitch.me/interactive-message`)
1. Save

#### Send a mock new ticket notification

Post the mock ticket JSON to the `/incoming` endpoint:

``curl -X POST -H 'Content-type: application/json' --data "`cat ./ticket.json`" <Your app server URL + /incoming>``

Example:
``curl -X POST -H 'Content-type: application/json' --data "`cat ./ticket.json`" https://slack-actionable-notification-blueprint.glitch.me/incoming``

*You need the ticket.json file in the same directory where you are sending the curl command!*
